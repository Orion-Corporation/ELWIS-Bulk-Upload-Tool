# ERAT: ELWIS Registration Tool

The ELWIS Registration Tool (ERAT) is designed to help users process SDF files and sort them based on ELWIS API responses. This tool simplifies the process of uploading SDF files to an API and categorizing the responses.

## Features

- **Upload to API**: Upload selected SDF files to a specified API endpoint (salt, solvate, compound).
